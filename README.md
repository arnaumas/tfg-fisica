# A variational derivation of the field equations of an action-dependent Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian

For the past century Einstein's theory of general relativity has constituted our most
advanced understanding of gravitation and all of its associated phenomena. Nevertheless,
there are still many puzzling and unanswered questions in the field of cosmology related
to the nature of the universe over large scales and its history. In recent years a number
of modified versions of general relativity have been developed and explored to attempt to
give satisfying answers to these questions. Among them is what is known as
action-dependent gravity. The mathematical framework for this theory is actually very deep
and not just related to relativity. Indeed, this is an example of what is known in
mathematics as contact geometry, the theory which describes the dynamics dissipative
systems, just as symplectic geometry underpins conservative Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
mechanics.

In this theory we apply recent developments in the field of contact geometry to a
successful derivation of the field equations of an action-dependent theory of gravity by
direct variation of a modified Einstein-Hilbert action.
