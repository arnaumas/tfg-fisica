In recent years there has been a great effort to study this type of dynamics both in theoretical aspects and in its potential applications in geometric mechanics and mathematical physics. This paper is intended to be a review of some of the results that the authors and their collaborators have recently obtained on the subject.},

This action principle enables us to formulate Lagrangian densities for nonconservative fields. In particular, from a Lagrangian depending linearly on the action, we obtain generalized Einstein field equations for nonconservative gravity and analyze some consequences of their solutions for cosmology and gravitational waves. We show that the nonconservative part of the field equations depends on a constant cosmological four-vector. Depending on this four-vector, the theory displays damped/amplified gravitational waves and an accelerating Universe without dark energy.},
