  abstract  = {We present a complete theory of higher-order autonomous contact mechanics, which allows us to describe higher-order dynamical systems with dissipation. The essential tools for the theory are the extended higher-order tangent bundles, \$\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}{\textasciicircum}kQ{\textbackslash}times\{{\textbackslash}mathbb R\}\$, whose geometric structures are previously introduced in order to state the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms for these kinds of systems, including their variational formulation. The variational principle, the contact forms, and the geometric dynamical equations are obtained by using those structures and generalizing the standard formulation of contact Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems. As an alternative approach, we develop a unified description that encompasses the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian equations as well as their relationship through the Legendre map; all of them are obtained from the contact dynamical equations and the constraint algorithm that is implemented because, in this formalism, the dynamical systems are always singular. Some interesting examples are finally analyzed using these geometric formulations.},

  abstract   = {The understanding of stellar structure represents the crossroads of our theories of the nuclear force and the gravitational interaction under the most extreme conditions observably accessible. It provides a powerful probe of the strong field regime of General Relativity, and opens fruitful avenues for the exploration of new gravitational physics. The latter can be captured via modified theories of gravity, which modify the Einstein-Hilbert action of General Relativity and/or some of its principles. These theories typically change the stellar structure equations, thus having a large impact on the astrophysical properties of the corresponding stars and opening a new window to constrain these theories with present and future observations. For relativistic (neutron) stars, the uncertainty on the equation of state of matter at supranuclear densities intertwines with the new parameters of the modified gravity side, providing new phenomenology for the predictions of stellar structure models, such as mass-radius relations, maximum masses, or moment of inertia. For non-relativistic stars (white, brown and red dwarfs), the weakening/strengthening of the gravitational force inside astrophysical bodies may induce changes on the star's mass, radius or luminosity, having an impact, for instance, in the Chandrasekhar's limit for white dwarfs, or in the minimum mass for stable hydrogen burning in brown dwarfs. This work aims to provide a broad overview of the main such results achieved in the recent literature, by combining the results and constraints obtained from the analysis of relativistic and non-relativistic stars in different scenarios. Moreover, we will build a bridge between the efforts of the community working on different theories, formulations, types of stars, theoretical modellings, and observational aspects, highlighting some of the most promising opportunities in the field.},

  abstract  = {We study static symmetric solutions in the context of a gravitational theory based on a action-dependent Lagrangian. Such theory has been designed as a setup to implement dissipative effects into the traditional principle of least action. Dissipation appears therefore from the first principles and has a purely geometric origin. An interesting feature of this theory is the existence of a coupling four-vector \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\$, which in an expanding background is related to cosmological bulk viscosity. General Relativity is recovered with a vanishing \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\$. We analyse the existence of equilibrium solutions of static configurations aiming to describe astrophysical objects. We find out that the existence of static spherically symmetric configurations occurs only in the particular scenario with vanishing \${\textbackslash}lambda\_t\$, \${\textbackslash}lambda\_r\$ and \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}phi\}\$ components i.e, \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}mu\}={\textbackslash}\{0,0,{\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}theta\},0{\textbackslash}\}\$. Thus, the component \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}theta\}\$ is the unique available parameter of the theory in the astrophysical context. This result severely constrains the existence of this sort of gravitational theories. We proceed then verifying the impact of \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}theta\}\$ on the stability and the mass-radius configurations for a reasonable equation of state for the cold dense matter inside compact stars. We further investigate the relativistic spherical collapse in order to track the structure of geometrical singularities appearing in the theory.},
