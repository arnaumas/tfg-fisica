This formulation is based on the \$k\$-contact geometry introduced in a previous paper, and gathers contact Lagrangian mechanics with \$k\$-symplectic Lagrangian field theory together.

  abstract     = {Contact Hamiltonian dynamics is a subject that has still a short history, but with relevant applications in many areas: thermodynamics, cosmology, control theory, and neurogeometry, among others. In recent years there has been a great effort to study this type of dynamics both in theoretical aspects and in its potential applications in geometric mechanics and mathematical physics. This paper is intended to be a review of some of the results that the authors and their collaborators have recently obtained on the subject.},

Much of the confusion surrounding such terms as gauge transformation and symmetry transformation as they are used in the context of Lagrangian theory is thereby eliminated, as we show. We discuss Noether's theorem for general symmetries of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian field theories. The cohomology associated to a group of symmetries of Hamiltonian or Lagrangian field theories is constructed and its relation with the structure of the current algebra is made apparent.},

This action principle enables us to formulate Lagrangian densities for nonconservative fields. In particular, from a Lagrangian depending linearly on the action, we obtain generalized Einstein field equations for nonconservative gravity and analyze some consequences of their solutions for cosmology and gravitational waves. We show that the nonconservative part of the field equations depends on a constant cosmological four-vector. Depending on this four-vector, the theory displays damped/amplified gravitational waves and an accelerating Universe without dark energy.},
