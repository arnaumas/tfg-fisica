  abstract   = {In this work, we propose an Action Principle for Action-dependent Lagrangian functions by generalizing the Herglotz variational problem to the case with several independent variables. We obtain a necessary condition for the extremum equivalent to the Euler-Lagrange equation and, through some examples, we show that this generalized Action Principle enables us to construct simple and physically meaningful Action-dependent Lagrangian functions for a wide range of non-conservative classical and quantum systems. Furthermore, when the dependence on the Action is removed, the traditional Action Principle for conservative systems is recovered.},

  abstract     = {Contact Hamiltonian dynamics is a subject that has still a short history, but with relevant applications in many areas: thermodynamics, cosmology, control theory, and neurogeometry, among others. In recent years there has been a great effort to study this type of dynamics both in theoretical aspects and in its potential applications in geometric mechanics and mathematical physics. This paper is intended to be a review of some of the results that the authors and their collaborators have recently obtained on the subject.},

In particular, we state a new form of the contact dynamical equations, and we review two recently presented Lagrangian formalisms, studying their equivalence. We define several kinds of symmetries for contact dynamical systems, as well as the notion of dissipation laws, prove a dissipation theorem and give a way to construct conserved quantities. Some well-known examples of dissipative systems are discussed.},

The concepts of symmetries and dissipation laws are introduced and developed. Two relevant examples are analyzed in detail: the damped vibrating string and Burgers' equation.},
